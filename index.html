            <h1>What is coding?</h1>
            <p>Coding is a thing that runs games, websites, and even your computer! Coding can go from zeros to ones to advacned lines of code.</p>
            <p>Ada Lovelace made a new type of machine called a "Analytical Engine". A sort of computer thing. Then in the 1940s people started making computers and started coding in assebly langauge to make apps. People started making better computers, which allowed people to make better and faster programs with new languages. Now there are many langauges such as Java, Html, Python and more.</p>
            <p>Coding is used for many things around the world. They use it for your websites you use and video games.</p>
            <p>Coding Makes your things work. They tell the computer what to show on your screen. In video games, the code detects what keys you press and moves the character. Coding tells your programs to run. Without coding, computers wouldn't be a thing!</p>

            <h1>What are games and websites made from?</h1>
            <p>Websites are normally made from HTMl (Hyper Text Markup Language. It uses elements to display things on the screen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Video games are made with Engines or other more powerful langauges like Java or python. Most games cannot be made in HTML because it can't run graphics or intense programs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>An engine, is a software that manages graphics, but also allows you to program the things. There are many games that are made in engines.</p>
